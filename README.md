First, make sure you have Python installed on your system.
Create a new directory for your project and navigate to it in the terminal.
Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```plaintext
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
```


Install the required packages:

```plaintext
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy
```


Create the files as shown above in your project directory.
Run the Flask application:

```plaintext
python app.py
```


Open a web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the application.
